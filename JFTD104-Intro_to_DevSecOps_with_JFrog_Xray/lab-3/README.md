### Package Manager Integration
- `cd JFTD104-Intro_to_DevSecOps_with_JFrog_Xray/lab-3/project-examples/npm-vulnerable-example`
- To pre-configured with the Artifactory server, repositories and use for building and publishing. The configuration is stored by the command in the .jfrog directory at the root directory of the project.)
  - Run 
  ```
  jf npmc --repo-resolve jftd104-npm-virtual --repo-deploy jftd104-npm-virtual 
  ```
- Run ``jf npm install --build-name swampup23_jftd104_npm_pipeline --build-number 1.0.0``
- Run ``jf npm publish --build-name swampup23_jftd104_npm_pipeline --build-number 1.0.0`` - Publish build Artifact to repository

### COLLECT ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

- Run ``jf rt bce swampup23_jftd104_npm_pipeline 1.0.0``

### COLLECT INFORMATION REGARDING GIT

- Run ``jf rt bag swampup23_jftd104_npm_pipeline 1.0.0``  - (.git path[Optional] - Path to a directory containing the .git directory. If not specific, the .git directory is assumed to be in the current directory or in one of the parent directories.)

### PUBLISH BUILD-INFO

- Run ``jf rt bp swampup23_jftd104_npm_pipeline 1.0.0``

### SCAN BUILD
- Scan a published build-info with Xray using **jf build-scan**
  ```
  jf bs swampup23_jftd104_npm_pipeline 1.0.0
  ```
- Additional commands, `--vuln`, `--fail`, `--format`, [more](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/CLI/CLI+for+JFrog+Xray#CLIforJFrogXray-ScanningPublishedBuilds)
- Xray should fail the build with the following raised security violations

- See violations in the Artifactory UI. Navigate to **Application** > **Security & Compliance** > **Watch Violations**. You will be able to see the watches that we have created in Step 1. Click on the `prod-watch`. The Violations tab in a Watch is the central location for viewing the detected violations based on the policies and rules you have predefined on the Watch. You can view the list of the violations, search for violations according to filters, set ignore rules and edit the Watch in the Settings tab.
